**androme<span style="color:maroon">da ta</span>u** is my blog dedicated to learning and sharing. And as an educational researcher, the learning never ends!

For my [data reflections](/reflection), I start with a topic that has been nagging at me. I find some data (or better yet, collect it), explore it using R, and share my thoughts on what I've found.

For my [book reviews](/review), well, I don't need to explain what a book review is, but the genres I gravitate toward are history and science fiction.

[ABOUT ME â†’](/about)
