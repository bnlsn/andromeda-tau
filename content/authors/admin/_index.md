By day, I am a Project Coordinator at the EASEL Lab at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where my research focuses on field-wide thinking about the organization, prioritization, and validation of social and emotional skills.

By night, when I'm not chasing a 5-year-old around, I am a self-learner in all things data, science, and history. Or you might find me reading a battered copy of a science fiction book from the '60s or '70s.
